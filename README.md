# webshop
 For my final thesis for the course web programming, I created a website for a web store of used high fashion goods. The technologies used are: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Bootstrap, PHP and AJAX. I've created a database linked to the items on the page, a functioning cart system as well as a register and login option.
